[Xpose](https://long-exposure.com)
 is a tool designed to help calculate long exposure times in photography. It is particularly usefull when using ND-filters, or when shooting film when you have to take reciprocity failure into account.
<br/>
<br/>
Xpose was originally created for personal use, and primarily designed for use outdoors on a mobile device. However, it might be usefull to others as well. Several updates are planned for the future, but keep in mind that i am not a developer and have to learn as i go :)
